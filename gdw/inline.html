	<h1>Inline Elements</h1>
	<p>This is a <strong>strong</strong> element. This element portrays information that the writer wants the reader to catch their attention.</p>
	<p>This is a <b>bolded</b> element. This element depicts important information in text.</p>
	<p>This is an <em>encoded</em> element. This element emphasises a word. </p>
	<p>This is an <i>italicized</i> element. This element italicizes a word.</p>
	<p>This is a <q>quotation</q> element. This element puts quotation marks around a word.</p>
	<p>This is an <code>source code enclosed</code> element. This element puts code into the html page. </p>
	<p>This is an <kbd>keyboard encolsed</kbd> element. This element changes the text to look like a computer keyboard character. </p>
	<p>This is an <sup>enclosed above subscript</sup> element. This element places smaler  text above the rest of the text to work as a note to refer the reader to some other part of the text.</p>
	<p>This is an <sub>enclosed below subscript</sub> element. This element places smaller text below the rest of the text to work as another way to refer the reader to another part of the text.</p>
	<p>This is an <span>incline logical span divisiont</span> element. This element is used to group a few elements together in an organized format. </p>
	<p>I did not see much change from normal text in the span element.  It just seemed to look like normal text with no formating unlike the other inline elements.</p>
