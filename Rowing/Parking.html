As you can see, I did more rearranging of files in your website, including
making changes to this homepage, seems it appears you didn't read my comment
from last week.

Time to choose a project and apply what you've learned up to now on creating
a website of your very own.

I did a bit of editing on this page, John, but this shouldn't be your homepage,
it should be the index.html page inside a gdw subdirectory. Let's talk next
week about that.
